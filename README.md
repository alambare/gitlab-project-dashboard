# GitLab project management dashboard

This projects build as a browser extension.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Load the content of the `build` folder as an **unpacked** extension in your browser.
